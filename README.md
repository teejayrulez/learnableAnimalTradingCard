# Animal trading card
My trading card is about the grey wolf, an endangered, yet facinating animal.

### Features
1. Code flow - Organized and coded using semantic Html 
2. Defined - Defined the class with great naming system and used the role attribute for non-sematicl elemts for both developer and non-develop to understand
3. Design - Got the inspiration By think outside the box and alittle bit of pinterest.
