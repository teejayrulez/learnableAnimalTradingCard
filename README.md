# Animal trading card
My trading card is about the grey wolf, an endangered, yet fascinating animal.

### Features
1. Code flow - Organized and coded using semantic Html.
2. Defined - Defined the class with great naming system and used the role attribute for non-sematic elements for both developer and non-develop to understand.
3. Design - Got the inspiration by thinking outside the box and alittle bit of pinterest.
