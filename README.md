# Animal trading card
My trading card is about the grey wolf(an endangered, yet facinating animal), The jaguar(The biggest cat in America), and The great white shark(One of the terror of the sea).

### Features
1. Code flow - Organized and coded using semantic Html.
2. Defined - Defined the class with great naming system and used the role attribute for non-sematic elements for both developer and non-developer to understand.
3. Design - Got the inspiration by thinking outside the box and alittle bit of pinterest.
